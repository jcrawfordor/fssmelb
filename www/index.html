      <h4>THE MARK OF PROFESSIONALISM</h4>
      <br />
      <p>The Free State of Socorro Medicine and Engineering Licensing Board is the official licensing body for medical professionals and engineers in the Free State of Socorro. FSSMELB licensing is required for the practice of zero to several professions in jurisdictions that may exist.</p>
      <h4>FOR CLIENTS</h4>
      <br />
      <p>An FSSMELB license gives you assurance that a practitioner, whether of medicine, engineering, or both, has passed a stringent selection process and proven a history of excellence.<p>
      <p>You can rest easy knowing that your medical care and/or engineering consultation is provided by a professional that has received a score on FSSMELB's intensive 12-part examination.</p>
      <p>An FSSMLB licensee's practical skills are validated by a mandatory hours-long apprenticeship in a state-of-the-industry discount retail or fast food environment.</p>
      <h4>FOR PROFESSIONALS</h4>
      <br />
      <p>There are so many reasons to become an FSSMELB Doctogineer. First, it makes you a professional, giving you the moral right to use the titles thereof. Second, it entitles you to one free consultation with a local exterminator each year. Last, and least, it makes you eligible for discount registration in the Annual Free State of Socorro Medicine and Engineering Footrace.</p>
